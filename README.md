# sudoku-collections
We used the Kaggle 1m sudoku repository and converted 3200 of them to minimal form, meaning you cannot remove a given without increasing the number of possible solutions. We then used these to generate 3095 improper sudokus with up to 16 possible solutions, including the solution sets.
